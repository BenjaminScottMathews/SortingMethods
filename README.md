# SortingMethods
A few different sorting methods, timed while operating on a vector of integers

These are classes I wrote to test and time different sorting methods on a vector of integers. Each time complexity is written in the specific sorting file, and the simple command line interface will process different sizes of input.
I've included three .txt files with 1000, 10000, and 100000 random numbers to be sorted by each algorithm, with a standard output stream and timer to print the number of seconds each sort takes.
I've included Radix and Counting sort as they can be utilized with integers, which is the only type we're sorting.
Enjoy!
